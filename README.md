What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?

I found it relatively easy to develop the server side implementation with Node.js. And also load the data into mongo db and query it.

What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?

I found hard to return only one record at a time from the server. And also removing the old records when new records arrive.

If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?

I would not be concerned with anything as these technologies are well designed and efficient.
